# Python Turing Machine Interpreter

This project was created by [@Yoween](https://github.com/Yoween) and [@Blazes35](https://github.com/Blazes35)


## Descrition

This project is a Python interpreter for the Turing Machine. The Turing Machine is an abstract mathematical model used in computer science to simulate algorithms and computing processes. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient tool for exploring the properties of the Turing Machine and for creating and executing programs.

## Requirements:

Python 3.6 or higher

`pyaml` library for configuration

`python-i18n` library for translations

`logging2` library for error logging

#### Windows :

```bash
pip install python-i18n[YAML] logging2
```

#### Linux :

```bash
pip3 install python-i18n[YAML] logging2
```

## Note :

The interpreter supports the standard Turing Machine operations, such as reading and writing to a tape, moving the tape head, and transitioning between states. It provides a graphical user interface for visualizing the machine's execution. The interpreter does not have a command-line interface.

This project is open source and contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with bug fixes, feature requests, or new functionality.
